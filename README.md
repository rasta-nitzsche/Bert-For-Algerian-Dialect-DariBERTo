# Bert-For-Algerian-Dialect-DariBERTo
We developped 2 BERT models that can understand Algerian dialect (Darija). One model is from scratch (You should execute the code on a server for many hours to train the model as we could not do this), we called it DariBERTo and 1 pretrained model from the Arabic language.
